- Hrishikesh here!
- Reiterating my favourite quote : "What I can not create, I do not understand" ~ Feynman

- My Goals for 2025: 
  * **Become an amazing and blazing fast algorithmic problem solver**
  * **Learn Core CS : Networks, Operating Systems, Database Management systems**
  * **Learn TypeScript and Backend Development (MERN)**
  * **Learn Stats, Deep Learning (NLP)**
 
  That's too much but I will try my best 😅
