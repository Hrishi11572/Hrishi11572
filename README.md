- Hrishikesh here!
- Reiterating my favourite quote : "What I can not create, I do not understand" ~ Feynman
- All my code is dumped here on Github 🌏
  
- My Goals for 2025 [Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec]: <br>

    ☞  **Complete 500 Algo problems set ... HARD !!** <br>
    ☞  **Learn Core CS : COA, Operating Systems** <br>
    ☞  **Complete Stats 110 (with assignments)** <br>
    ☞  **Build and break as much as python and cpp code as possible 🐍** <br>
 
  That's too much but I will try my best 😅
