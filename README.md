- Reiterating my favourite quote : <b>"What I can not create, I do not understand" ~ Feynman</b>
- All my code is dumped here on Github 🌏
  
- My Goals for 2026 : <br>

      ☞   Learn as much math as possible 👾 
      ☞   Build my own software from lang to os 📝
      ☞   Physics awaits my arrival. I want to understand Einstein. 
    
  **Build and break a good lot of python, cpp code along the way 🐍** <br>
