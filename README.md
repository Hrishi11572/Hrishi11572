- My Goals for 2025: 
  * **Become an amazing and blazing fast algorithmic problem solver**
  * Learn TypeScript and Backend Development (most probably MERN stack)
  * Learn one systems programming language deeply (either Rust or C++)
  * Become hugely better at Math - specially at Prob-Stats & Puzzles
  * Have fun learning and building ML and agentic models, yay ....
